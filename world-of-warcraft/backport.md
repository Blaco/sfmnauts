# Backporting WoD stuff to MoP

You can actually get WoD stuff into MoP if you really wish to.

You require this stuff:
* [CascView](http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html)
* [WoW CASC Listfile](https://github.com/bloerwald/LegionFiles)
* [MPQ Editor](http://www.zezula.net/en/mpq/download.html)

Just export stuff to a folder via CASCView and then create a new MPQ archive (World of Warcrat type MPQ, **NOT** MoP MPQ type of archive.) and then just slap it into the "MPQ Archives order and files to load". The custom MPQ archive should be on top.

Then you'll just find it easily.
