## Credits

This guide was **written and contributed** by **steak**, you can find him on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/ThunderySteak) and on [**Steam**](http://steamcommunity.com/id/wtfidonteven/).

These are the guides respective to the **World of Warcraft** game. 

These guides will only explain to you how to extract content from various WoW clients, which WoW clients are recommended and the required tools.

These guides **DO NOT** talk about how to obtain a specific WoW client build, and it is expected that you backed up your retail builds, or know how to obtain one. 

If you want to find a specific build, Google is your friend.

If you have any questions, message me on Discord -> **steak#3816**
