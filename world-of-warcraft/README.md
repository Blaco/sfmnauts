## Credits

This guide was written and contributed by **steak**, you can find him on **[Twitter]**(https://twitter.com/ThunderySteak) and on **[Steam]**(http://steamcommunity.com/id/wtfidonteven/).

These are the guides respective to the **World of Warcraft** game. 

These guides will only explain to you how to extract content from various WoW clients, which WoW clients are recommended and the required tools.

These guides **DO NOT** talk about how to obtain a specific WoW client build, and it is expected that you backed up your retail builds, or know how to obtain one. 

If you want to find a specific build, Google is your friend.

If you have any questions, message me on Discord -> steak#3816 

I'm not responsible if you break something.
