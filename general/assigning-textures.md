## Assigning Textures in 3DSMax assuming your model tells you what textures are missing.

If the **Material Editor** shows us what texture we need, you can do the following:

Simply **open the Material Editor** and **scroll down until you find "scene materials"** and voila!

You have now found the texture you need.

That's one method, however there's a **better method.**

**Import your mesh and then save your scene.**

You can now press **Shift+T** in 3DSMax which will open a list of missing textures. If you **right click it**, and hit **set path** you can more easily define the path to your textures. Just set the **path to the folder** in the **path category** and then **filename.dds** in the **file category.**
