# Introduction

The SFM community is a lovely and wonderful place to get some fanmade animations and content out there.

Some people would like to take it a step further and help out the community by porting content to it or would like to get a certain model from the game, though do not know how. This results in a bunch of begging and other general nonsense, and it doesn't help that the information is hard to come by or kept under wraps sometimes. On top of that, I imagine people repeatedly asking a singular question such as "HOW 2 PROT" -- even when coming with good intent, can get simply annoying for said person, so why not publish the information where all may access it?

Many will be contributing to this wiki in an effort to lessen this dilemma, mostly focusing on PBR -&gt; Source texture conversation, but will write full write ups on how to port from beginning to end on some of these.

This is, of course, **going to assume that you have general knowledge of Photoshop and some experience working with models.**

**It's not geared toward dumbies.**

There may be times where you might laugh and scoff and say "There's a better way to do this!" **and I openly invite you to PLEASE contribute. **The reality is these are methods that are being added that I have been taught to the best of my ability or with the limited time I was able to spend on them with whoever taught them **in order to come up with at least average results.**

If you'd like to contribute, either [DM ](https://twitter.com/ballerfuturistc)me or message me on Discord &gt; **Mars\#1305**

**yes, you need to include the capital M, i think.**

## Credits

**None of this** would be possible without the help of these people:

* **Blueflytrap**
* **Sundownsyndrome**
* **Kuroyasviel** [\[1\]](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Memeyasviel)

As in, literately, I don't think anyone else would have figured this out -- it's crazy the amount of work and effort they've put into this and I ask that you respect their wishes and work.

## Disclaimer

Everything is subject to change based on if the methods change.

I do not claim to know what I am doing. I am merely spreading the information after testing if it works.

I'm going off the basis that some information is better than none, so some things might be incomplete or lack the information you want. I'll try to mark them appropriately..
