## Notes

This guide will be based around 3DSMax, since that's what I use, but everything should pretty much be the same!

According to **huntingrifle** on **Facepunch**

1. Unpacking the meshes gave two file formats, .mesh and .model, of which only .model is needed. Trying to import .mesh files crashes 3DS Max 2012 \(and I'm assuming any version of Max\), except for a few static models which had literally no difference compared to the .model format. I don't have Maya to check if it happens there as well, but as I said, here's no difference even if you could import it. I only included the .model formats in the download link.

**Also, a couple of models under the dynamic -- mostly humanoids and anything that seems to have complex rigging crashes on import.**

**For those dynamic models that crash, try importing .mesh instead, it seems to work sometimes.**

## Importing

Importing is honestly pretty straightforward, after installing the plugin, make sure you restarted 3DSMax.

Then simply go to **file -&gt; import** and import the **.model**

## Assigning Textures

So, it turns out the **Material Editor** shows us what texture we need!

Simply **open the Material Editor** and **scroll down until you find "scene materials" **and voila!

You have now found the texture you need.
