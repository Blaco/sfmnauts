## Importing

You can import Metro Redux **maps** into 3DSMax, possibly Maya -- but I haven't tried with Maya.

Make sure you have the [**importer tools for your relative software**](/metro-redux/tools.md).

For this, you'll simply have to [**unpack**](/metro-redux/tools.md) the game yourself.

After **unpacking** the game, browse to the folder made by the unpacker, i.e:

`content\maps\2033 or your respective game that you've chosen`

Simply pick your level and import the **.geom\_pc** file in 3DSMax.

Voila!

One full map.
