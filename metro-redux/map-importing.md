## Importing

You can import Metro Redux **maps** into 3DSMax, possibly Maya -- but I haven't tried with Maya.

For this, you'll simply have to [**unpack**](/metro-redux/tools.md) the game yourself.

After **unpacking** the game, browse to the folder made by the unpacker, i.e:

`content\maps\2033 or your respective game that you've chosen`

Simply pick your level and import the **.geom\_pc **file in 3DSMax.

Voila!

One full map.

## Assigning Textures

So, it turns out the **Material Editor** shows us what texture we need!

Simply **open the Material Editor** and **scroll down until you find "scene materials" **and voila!

You have now found the texture you need.
