NinjaRipper should be used as a last resort. It fucks up smoothing and is generally honestly messy to import as it messes with filenames and finding out the corresponding texture will be hard, but it should do the job.

Apparently, if you edit the .rip in Notepad++ -- near the header should be the corresponding texture, but I can't confirm nor deny this right now.

It should be straightforward to use, so I'll leave writing a guide for this til later.
